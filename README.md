# User Guide:Creating a Data-to-Knowledge Package

## Note: This document is a draft. Please send your questions, comments, and suggestions to m.konkol[at]52north.org.
This user guide provides instructions on how to create a Data-to-Knowledge Package (D2K-Package) as described in this paper (<INSERT LINK>).
## Problem statement:
Publishing and reusing reproducible research is challenging. Users still need to make considerable efforts to understand the data and analysis code before they can reuse parts of the analysis in other contexts.
## Solution:
Based on a reproducible basis (code + data + computational environment), further applications including virtual labs, web API services, and workflows are built to provide an entry point to the analysis and encourage reuse.
Target audience:
Users who have an analysis pipeline and would like to create a D2K-Package out of it.
